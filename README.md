###Review Plan
- Initializing an angular app
- Controller
  - Creating a controller
  - `ng-controller`
  - $scope
- Some directives
  - `ng-model`
    - Meant to take user input into the controller
    - input, select, textarea
    - DOUBLE BOUND
  - `ng-repeat`
    - Repeat an HTML template for a list of similar data
    - Dynamic List of HTML elements
    - `$index`
  - `ng-show`
    - Show or hide some html
    - Shows if evaluates to truthy
  - `ng-style`
    - Dynamically change style of an element
  - Also filters (not a directive)
    - Hide items from a list dynamically
    - Order a list
  - Some new ones if you want
    - `ng-options`

- Services
  - Creating a Service
  - Talking to controllers
    - Injecting into controllers
    - Push/Pull methodology
